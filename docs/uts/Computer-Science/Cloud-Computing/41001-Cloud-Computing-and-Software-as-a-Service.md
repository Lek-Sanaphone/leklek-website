### What is Cloud Computing?
#### Software Architecture Paradigm Shifts

The transition to cloud delivery was enabled by three major shifts in software design:
* **Process-Oriented (1960s–80s)**: Programs were composed of tightly coupled processes acting on shared data, making reuse difficult.
* **Object-Oriented (1980s–90s)**: Real-world entities were modeled as objects encapsulating data, communicating via messages.
* **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) (2000s+)**: Applications became modular sets of independent services with standard interfaces. SOA provided the modular, reusable foundation necessary for cloud distribution.


#### NIST Definition and Core Concepts

NIST defines cloud computing as a model for on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable resources (servers, storage, applications) that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management. It is characterized by:

* **Resource Pooling**: Shared physical infrastructure serves multiple consumers through multi-tenancy.
* **Service Delivery**: Computing is delivered as a service rather than a physical product.
* **Elasticity**: Resources scale up or down instantly to match actual demand.



#### Six Defining Parameters of Cloud Computing

A true cloud environment must meet these six criteria:

1. **Pooled Resources**: Providers maintain global resource pools (Compute, Storage, Network) accessible regardless of geography.
2. **Elastic Scaling**: Capacity follows demand curves precisely, eliminating wasted costs and preventing crashes during spikes.
3. **Virtualization**: Physical hardware is sliced into Virtual Machines (VMs) using a hypervisor layer.
4. **Metered Usage**: A "pay-as-you-go" model where usage is tracked at a granular level (per second or GB), converting capital risk into operating cost.
5. **Internet Delivery**: Resources are accessed via APIs and categorized as IaaS (raw infrastructure), PaaS (dev platforms), or SaaS (ready-made apps).
6. **Automated Lifecycle**: Provisioning and de-provisioning are fully automated through self-service portals, requiring no human intervention.

#### Utility Computing: The Fifth Utility

Cloud computing fulfills the vision of computing as the fifth utility, following water, electricity, gas, and the internet. Like traditional utilities, it offers on-demand availability, seamless scaling, and pay-per-unit consumption without the need for the user to own or maintain the underlying infrastructure.

#### Business Benefits

* **Financial Shift**: Moves IT spending from large upfront Capital Expenditure (CapEx) to manageable Monthly Operational Expense (OpEx).
* **Operational Focus**: IT staff shift focus from maintaining hardware to core business innovation.
* **Global Agility**: Organizations can scale globally and achieve faster time-to-market without building their own data centers.
