# 1. Introduction to Information System Development (ISD)
## 1.1 Lecture

### Purpose of Information Systems (IS)
The primary goal of an Information System is to facilitate business decision-making by providing accurate and timely information. It typically supports organizational activities such as forecasting, planning, control, and coordination.

* **Core Services**: Includes data collection, storage, and retrieval (e.g., sales transactions).
* **Data Transformation**: Application programs transform raw data into useful information.
* **Management**: Uses intelligence tools and policies for data management, such as stock taking.

### Drivers for IS Development Projects

Information System projects arise because the world and business requirements are constantly changing.

* **Performance Gaps**: Existing systems may fail to perform as required due to changes in government policies or external environments.
* **Competitive Advantage**: Organizations pursue new opportunities, such as leveraging AI techniques, to gain a lead.
* **Operational Excellence**: Projects often aim to reduce costs, such as inventory control systems that manage stock levels.
* **Technological Adaptation**: Systems must be migrated to new environments like the cloud or re-architected for mobile platforms.

### The Importance of Methodologies

Methodologies provide a systematic framework to ensure a system meets user needs and to avoid costly failures.

* **Risk Mitigation**: Large IT projects frequently suffer from budget overruns (avg. 45%) and schedule delays.
* **Value Delivery**: Without a structured method, projects often align poorly with business objectives; only 34% of projects are reported to deliver value consistently.
* **Critical Failures**: Approximately 17% of large projects go so poorly they threaten the company's existence, and over 30% are never finished.

### ISDM and Types of Development Methodologies (Heavyweight vs Lightweight)

Methodologies are generally categorized based on the level of control and flexibility they provide.

#### What is ISDM?
* An Information System Development Methodology (ISDM) is a systematic process used to develop information systems that meet specific organizational and user needs.
* It acts as a framework to manage the complex interaction between business drivers, technology drivers, and various project stakeholders.

#### Key Components of ISDM
* **Phases**: A series of structured steps:
    * **Initiation**: Defining the project scope and objectives.
    * **Analysis**: Understanding user requirements.
    * **Design**: Creating the system architecture and design.
    * **Implementation**: Building and testing the system.
* **Techniques**: Specific methods used within phases (e.g., interviews, prototyping, testing).
* **Tools**: Software or templates that support the process (e.g., CASE tools, project management software).



#### Methodologies
<details>
<summary>Heavyweight Methodologies</summary>

These methodologies impose greater control and are process-oriented.

* **Best Use Cases**: Ideal for larger teams (**20+ members**), multiple teams working in different locations, or high-stake projects with significant risk.
* **Examples**: PRINCE2 and RUP.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Lightweight Methodologies</summary>

These focus on people over processes and accommodate change well.

* **Characteristics**: They utilize smaller teams, dynamic checklists, and foster knowledge sharing.
* **Improvement Cycles**: These methods rely on iterations, allowing teams to learn from each build and correct issues throughout the project.
* **Examples**: SCRUM (the most popular at 43%), XP, and KANBAN.

</details>

### Selecting a Methodology

The selection of a specific methodology depends on several key factors:

* **Project Constraints**: Budget, team size, and the criticality of the project.
* **Technical Environment**: The technology used and the software requirements.
* **Organizational Assets**: Existing processes, documentation standards, and lessons learned from previous projects.
