# 31282 and 32571 - Summary
# 1. Introduction to Software Quality and Software Quality Assurance
## 1. Software Testing and Quality Assurance

### Software Quality and Software Quality Assurance (SQA)


- **Software quality** is often a moral and legal requirement.
- **Quality** (almost) always comes with a cost.
- **Cost Categories**:
    - **Prevention Costs:** Training, planning, early reviews/testing.
    - **Appraisal Costs:** Inspections and testing.
    - **Failure Costs:** Rework, complaint handling, loss management.


### Measuring Software Quality

- Technical Quality Parameters
    - **Correctness:** Defect rate
    - **Reliability:** Failure rate
    - **Capability:** Requirements coverage
    - **Maintainability:** Ease of modification
    - **Performance:** Speed, memory, and resource efficiency
- User Quality Parameters
    - **Usability:** User satisfaction
    - **Installability:** Installation experience
    - **Documentation:** Clarity and usefulness of manuals
    - **Availability:** System uptime and access
- Quality Models and Standards
    - **McCall’s Quality Factors:** Operation, Transition, Revision
    - **Standards:** ISO/IEC 90003:2018, CMMI


### Software Quality Assurance (SQA)

- SQA is a structured set of activities to ensure both the software product and its development process meet functional, technical, and managerial requirements.
- Objectives:
    - Prevent defects early in development
    - Improve development and maintenance efficiency
    - Ensure alignment with quality goals

### Three Principles of SQA

1. **Know What You Are Doing**: Understand current system state and project progress. Maintain clear reporting, structure, and planning.

2. **Know What You Should Be Doing**: Maintain and track up-to-date requirements and specifications. Use acceptance criteria, prototypes, and user feedback.

3. **Measure the Difference**:Use tests and metrics to compare actual vs. expected performance. Quantify quality (e.g., percentage of passed test cases).



### SQA Environment Considerations

1. **Contractual Requirements** – Timeline, budget, functional scope
2. **Customer-Supplier Relationship** – Active collaboration and validation
3. **Team Collaboration** – Diverse skills and mutual review
4. **Inter-team Cooperation** – External expertise and project division
5. **System Interfaces** – Interaction with other software systems
6. **Team Turnover** – Knowledge transfer and onboarding
7. **Software Maintenance** – Long-term operational quality
