## 1. What is Cloud Computing?
### Cloud Computing
- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources‚Äîsuch as servers, storage, and databases‚Äîvia the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing. It replaces traditional data centers by allowing users to instantly provision and scale resources without upfront costs.
- **The Deployment Models of the Cloud:**
    - Public Cloud: Provided by third parties (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
    - Private Cloud: Dedicated to a single organization
    - Hybrid Cloud: Mix of public and private
- **Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing:**
    - On-demand access, broad network availability, shared resources (multi-tenancy), rapid scalability, and pay-per-use.
- **Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:**
    - Trade capital expense for variable expense
    - Benefit from massive economies of scale
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Increase speed and agility
    - Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers 
    - Go global in minutes

### Types of Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is categorized into three main service models:
    - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
        - Provides raw resources like storage, networking, and virtual machines. You manage everything above the infrastructure.
        - Example: AWS EC2, Azure, DigitalOcean

    - PaaS (Platform as a Service):
        - Providers manage infrastructure and runtime; you manage only your apps and data.
        - Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine

    - SaaS (Software as a Service):
        - Fully managed products; users only use the software without managing infrastructure.
        - Example: Gmail, Dropbox, Zoom
- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals (pay-as-you-go model):
    - Compute: Pay per usage time
    - Storage: Pay per GB stored
    - Networking: Pay only for outbound data, free for inbound data
### Global Infrastructure
- [AWS Global Infrastructure Visual](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
    - Regions: Clusters of data centers. Three or more Availability Zones. (e.g., us-east-1)
    - Availability Zones: Isolated zones with low-latency, redundant setups
    - Edge Locations: 400+ global points for fast content delivery

### Security in Cloud: The Shared Responsibility Model & AWS Acceptable Use
- **Shared Responsibility Model**:
    - Customer: Security in the cloud (data, OS, network, firewall)
    - AWS: Security of the cloud (infra, hardware, software)
- **Acceptable Use Policy**:
    - **Prohibits** illegal, harmful, offensive, or abusive activities on AWS.

## 2. IAM - Identity and Access Management
### Users, Groups, and (Permissions) Policies
- IAM is a global AWS service used to manage users, groups, and permissions.
    <img src="https://cdn-web.sysbee.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BLOG-AWS-IAM-Users-and-Groups.jpg?x95424" width="500"/>
    - Users represent individuals; groups are collections of users (groups cannot contain other groups).
    - Users can belong to multiple groups or none (though grouping is best practice).
- The root user is created by default for account setup only and should not be used afterward.
- Permissions are granted through IAM policies (JSON documents) assigned to users/groups.

### IAM User & Groups Hands On
<details>
  <summary>Creating IAM User and Group</summary>

  - IAM is a global service (no region selection).
  - Avoid using the root user for daily tasks; create IAM users instead.
  - Create users via the IAM console, set passwords, and assign to groups for easier permission management.
  - Use IAM policies (e.g., AdministratorAccess) by attaching them to groups (e.g., "admin").
  - Tags are optional metadata for organization (e.g., department = engineering).
  - Sign in using account ID or alias ‚Äì Each AWS account has a unique ID. To simplify the IAM user login URL, you can create a custom account alias (e.g., aws-stephane-v3) to replace the account ID in the sign-in link.
  - Use separate browser windows (normal + incognito) to manage root and IAM users simultaneously.
  - Best practice: Secure all credentials and use IAM users for daily operations.

</details>

### IAM Policies & Hands On
- IAM policies are **JSON documents** that define permissions in AWS.

- Policies can be attached to:
    - <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*3vJan5-ixsmwVqKRfdda-Q.png" width="500" height="250" />
    - Groups (shared by all members)
    - Users directly (inline policies)
    - Multiple groups (users inherit combined permissions)

#### Policy Structure
<details>
    <summary>Example of Json Structure</summary>
    ```
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",
    "Statement": [
        {
        "Sid": "1",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
        },
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
</details>

- Policy Structure Key Parts:
    - **Version**: Policy format (usually "2012-10-17")
    - **Id**: An optional identifier for the policy.
    - **Statement**: Contains one or more permission rules
    - **Sid**: (optional) Statement ID
    - **Effect**: "Allow" or "Deny"
    - **Principal**: Who the policy applies to
    - **Action**: What actions are allowed/denied (e.g., s3:GetObject)
    - **Resource**: What resources the actions apply to (e.g., an S3 bucket)
    - **Condition**: (optional) When the policy applies

#### IAM Policies Hands On

<details>
    <summary>Hands On</summary>
* **User Permissions:**
  IAM users gain permissions from:

  * **Group memberships** (e.g., `admin`, `developers`)
  * **Directly attached policies** (e.g., `IAMReadOnlyAccess`)

* **Group Removal**: Removing a user from a group instantly removes its permissions.

* **Direct Policy**: Attach policies like IAMReadOnlyAccess to give limited access directly to a user.


* **Multiple Policy Sources:**
  Users can have multiple policies from different groups and direct attachments ‚Äî permissions are cumulative.

* **Custom Policies:**
  Create using a visual editor or JSON to define specific permissions (e.g., `ListUsers`, `GetUser`).

</details>

### IAM MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Adds a second layer of security by requiring both a password (something you know) and an MFA device (something you own).
- AWS Console -> Account settings -> Edits

### Type of MFA
- Soft Token Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device: This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è
- Hardware Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device: A hardware device that generates a six-digit numeric code
- U2F security key: USB
- Virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device: Software app (ex: Google Authentication)

### AWS Access Keys, CLI, and SDK & Hands On
- Access Methods: Management Console, CLI, and SDK.
- Access Keys: Consists of an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
    - Used for CLI and SDK access.
    - Must be kept private ‚Äî each user should generate their own.
- AWS CLI: command in terminal, ideal for automation and scripting. [See more](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli).
    - Download package from official web to setup aws.
- SDK: Integrates AWS calls into app code. Manage your AWS services using a programming language.

#### Access Keys and CLI - Hands On
<details>
    <summary>Hands on</summary>
    1. AWS Console -> IAM -> Users -> your user -> Security credentials -> **Create access key**
    2. Use case: CLI -> Tick Confirmation -> Download .csv file
    3. Login to aws account in CLI:
```
aws configure
```
    4. Run aws iam list-users to view IAM users
</details>
- Alternative to this option is to use **aws cloudshell** (CLI in cloud). [Cloudshell Supported Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/supported-aws-regions.html).
- Logging into your **AWS account** via terminal. Lets you create, modify, or delete AWS resources (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM users, etc.).

### IAM Roles for Services
* IAM Roles grant **AWS services** permissions to act on your behalf. Used by services, not users (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
    * Example: An **EC2 instance** uses an IAM Role to access AWS resources (e.g., S3) based on the role‚Äôs permissions.
* Common roles: [EC2 Instance Role](#ec2-instance-role), Lambda Role, CloudFormation Role.
* **Key Purpose:** Securely manage service permissions without using long-term credentials.


### IAM Security Tools/Audit - Credentials Report & Access Advisor

* **Credentials Report:**
  Checks if users have secure credentials (e.g., strong passwords, MFA, rotated access keys). ‚Üí Use it to **audit user security**.
  * AWS Console -> IAM -> Credentials Report

* **Access Advisor:**
  Shows which AWS services a user has actually used and when. ‚Üí Use it to **remove unused permissions** and enforce least privilege.
  * AWS Consloe -> IAM -> User -> your user -> Access Advisor

## 3. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

### What is EC2?
* **EC2:**
  AWS service for renting virtual machines (instances) ‚Äî part of **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**.
    * **Customize**: OS, CPU, RAM, storage, network, and security groups.
    * **User Data (Bootstrapping):**
  run setup scripts at first launch (with root access)

    * **Instance Types:**
  Wide range of options (e.g.: `t2.micro`) for different workloads.

* [Hands-On: Launching EC2 with User Data Script (Based on Similar Setup)](https://youtu.be/WXxVr01ezgM?si=Jgx0MTikIWRQdZBi)

### EC2 Instance Types

* **Instance Naming:**
  Format: `Class + Generation + Size` (e.g., `m5.2xlarge`)

  * `m` = represent Instance Class as "general purpose"
  * `5` = 5th generation
  * `2xlarge` = size (more CPU/RAM)

* **Main EC2 Categories:**

  * **General Purpose (T, M)** ‚Äì Balanced (e.g., `t2.micro`, free tier)
  * **Compute Optimized (C)** ‚Äì CPU-heavy workloads (e.g., ML, video encoding)
  * **Memory Optimized (R, X, Z)** ‚Äì RAM-intensive tasks (e.g., DBs, analytics)
  * **Storage Optimized (I, G, H)** ‚Äì High-speed local storage (e.g., OLTP, data warehouses)

* [More Instance-types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

### Security Groups & Classic Ports
* Security Groups:
Act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling **inbound and outbound** traffic using $\color{tomato}\text{allow-only}$ rules.

* <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6SJn30JjmBQ/maxresdefault.jpg" width="500" height="300" />

* Security Groups Rules Include:
    * Type (e.g. SSH, HTTP)
    * Protocol (e.g. TCP)
    * Port number
    * Source (IP range or another security group)

* Key Features:
    * One security group can be attached to multiple instances
    * Instances can have multiple security groups
    * Security groups are region + VPC specific
    * Can reference other security groups for secure internal communication
        * <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*USnlyvt1pohoVspnmFj7LA.png" width="500" height="300" />

### SSH vs Access Key
| Feature     | AWS Access Key & CLI                        | SSH into EC2                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Interact with AWS services programmatically | Remote login to a specific EC2 Linux server |
| Credentials | IAM access key + secret key                 | SSH key pair (.pem file)                    |
| Tool used   | AWS CLI                                     | SSH client (e.g., Terminal, PuTTY)          |
| Accessing   | AWS APIs (create, list, delete resources)   | The actual EC2 virtual machine              |


### EC2 Instance Role
-  The Amazon Linux AMI comes with the AWS CLI pre-installed.
    - Never use aws configure or store access keys on EC2 instances ‚Äî it's a security risk.
- Instead, use [IAM Roles](#iam-roles-for-services) to securely grant EC2 instances permissions. Link to IAM roles.
- [See Demo: IAM Roles on EC2 Instances Tutorial](https://youtu.be/TlCuOjviOhk?si=h5OH9K0M82xcRmPd)

### EC2 Instance Purchasing Options 
* **On-Demand:**
  * Pay per use, no commitment
  * Ideal for short, unpredictable workloads
  * Highest cost

* **Reserved Instances (RI):**
  * 1- or 3-year commitment
  * Up to **72% discount**
  * Best for steady, long-term workloads (e.g., databases)
  * **Convertible RIs** allow instance changes (lower discount)

* **Savings Plans:**
  * Commit to **spend (\$/hr)**, not instance type
  * 1- or 3-year term
  * Up to **70% discount**
  * More flexible than RIs (across OS, size, tenancy)

* **Spot Instances:**
  * Up to **90% off**, but can be **interrupted anytime**
  * Purchase unused AWS EC2 capacity
  * Great for **fault-tolerant** tasks like batch jobs, ML, image processing
  * Not suited for critical or persistent workloads

* **Dedicated Hosts:**
  * Entire physical server for your use
  * Needed for **compliance/licensing**
  * Most expensive option
  * Better visibility & placement control

* **Dedicated Instances:**
  * Run on hardware dedicated to you
  * No control over placement
  * Less isolation than Dedicated Hosts

* **Capacity Reservations:**
  * Reserve capacity in a specific AZ
  * No discounts; pay **on-demand pricing**
  * Ensures availability for **short-term or burst workloads**

## 4. EC2 Instance Storage
### EBS - Elastic Block Store & Hands On
#### EBS Volume
- Persistent storage, meaning data remains intact even if the instance is terminated.

#### EBS Volume Attachment and Availability Zones
- One EBS Volume ‚Üí One EC2 instance (at Cloud Practitioner level). Multi-Attach is available only for io1/io2 volumes at Associate level and above.
- AZ-bound: Volumes are tied to a specific Availability Zone (AZ).
- To move across AZs, create a snapshot, then restore it in the target AZ.
- Attachment Behavior:
    - <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*OhcL2XQFZSgwiXE2N2fXsg.png" width="450" height="200" />
    - One EC2 instance can have multiple EBS volumes.
    - Volumes can be created unattached and attached later.

#### Delete on Termination Attribute
- Controls whether a volume is deleted when the instance is terminated.
    - Root volume: deleted by default.
    - Other volumes: retained by default.
- You can customize this setting via the AWS Console/AWS CLI.

#### EBS Hands On
<details>
    <summary>Creating, Detaching, Default, and Terminate</summary>

- Exploring EBS Volumes on **EC2**
    - Each EC2 instance has a root EBS volume (e.g., 8‚ÄØGB by default).
    - You can view attached volumes via the Storage tab or the Volumes section in the AWS Console.

- Creating and Attaching a New Volume
    - Create additional EBS volumes (e.g., 2‚ÄØGB, GP2).
    - Must be created in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as the EC2 instance.
    - Attach the new volume via Actions ‚Üí Attach Volume.
    - The instance can now have multiple volumes attached (e.g., root + additional).

- AZ Restriction Demonstrated
    - EBS volumes are tied to their AZ.
    - A volume in eu-west-1a cannot be attached to an instance in eu-west-1b.

- Delete on Termination Behavior
    - Root volume has "Delete on Termination" = Yes by default.
    - Additional volumes are not deleted on instance termination unless configured.
    - You can change this setting during launch or via volume settings.

- Deleting Volumes
    - Volumes can be deleted anytime via Actions ‚Üí Delete Volume.
    - Detached volumes remain available and manageable independently.

- Key Takeaways
    - EBS volumes are AZ-specific and attachable/detachable dynamically.
    - Root volumes are deleted by default upon instance termination.
    - Additional volumes persist unless explicitly set to delete.
    - To use the new volume that is attached. [Need Formatting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-using-volumes.html). Out of Scope
</details>

### EBS Snapshots & Hands On
- Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes that can be used to restore data even after volume deletion. No need to detach the volume, but it's recommended for data consistency.
- Use Cases
    - Backup and restore EBS volumes.
    - Move data across Availability Zones or Regions by restoring snapshots elsewhere.
    - Useful for migration, replication, and disaster recovery.
- **Recycle Bin**: Retains deleted snapshots for 1‚Äì365 days. Protects against accidental deletion.

#### EBS Snapshots Hands On
<details>
    <summary>Creating, Viewing, Copying, and Recycle Bin</summary>
- Creating a Snapshot
    - Select a EC2 ‚Üí Elastic Block Store ‚Üí Volume ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Create Snapshot.

- Viewing Snapshots
    - Select a EC2 ‚Üí Elastic Block Store ‚Üí Snapshots

- Copying Snapshots Across Regions
    - Select snapshot ‚Üí Copy Snapshot ‚Üí choose target region.
    - Useful for disaster recovery and cross-region backup.


- Creating a Volume from a Snapshot
    - Select snapshot ‚Üí Create Volume from Snapshot.
    - Choose size, AZ, encryption, and tags.
    - Enables cross-AZ volume creation.

- Recycle Bin Feature
    - Protects against accidental deletion of snapshots and AMIs.
    - Create a $\color{tomato}\text{Retention Rule}$ with a name, resource type, and duration (e.g., 1 day).
    - Deleted snapshots go to Recycle Bin, not lost permanently.
</details>


### AMI - Amazon Machine Image & Hands On
- An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a preconfigured template used to launch EC2 instances.
- You need to add: OS, software license, configurations, and monitoring tools.
- Types of AMIs
    - AWS-provided AMIs (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
    - Custom AMIs created by users for tailored environments.
    - Marketplace AMIs from third-party vendors, available for purchase/use.
- AMI Creation Process
    - Launch and customize an EC2 instance.
    - Stop the instance to ensure integrity.
    - Create an AMI from an EC2 instance, AWS creates **EBS snapshots** of the instance‚Äôs volumes behind the scenes. 
    - Use the AMI to launch new EC2 instances, even in other AZs.
- Requirement:
    - The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) must be in the same region as that of the Amazon EC2 instance to be launched. 
    - If the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) exists in a different region, you can copy that Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to the region where you want to launch the EC2 instance.
#### AMI Hands On
- [See Demo: Creating and Launching](https://youtu.be/RR9b0g_Ghrw?si=cYVdJVlMUpcSJ9Pz)

### EC2 Image Builder
- A service that **automates** the creation, maintenance, testing, and distribution of **AMIs** for EC2 instances.
- How It Works
    - <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*7CuEHqTvk5wK5_-jip9-og.png" height="180" width="700"/>
    - Builder EC2 instance is launched to customize software (e.g., install Java, update CLI, OS patches).
    - After setup, an **AMI** is created automatically.
    - Optionally, after AMI creation, Image Builder can automatically test the AMI by launching test EC2 instances.
- Created AMIs can be copied across regions to support global deployments.


### EC2 Instance Store 
- Hardware-attached storage directly connected to the EC2 host, offering higher I/O performance than EBS but without data persistence.
- Key Characteristics
    - Ephemeral storage: data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.
    - Not suitable for persistent or long-term storage.
- Ideal for temporary data, such as: Buffers, Caches, Scratch space


### EFS (Elastic File System)
- A managed network file system (NFS) that can be mounted to multiple Linux EC2 instances simultaneously.
- Shared file system accessible across multiple Availability Zones.
- Key Features
    - <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Vz9BS4uksguiE9OGvr8EYg.png" height="180" width="400"/>
    - Highly available, scalable, and fully managed.
    - Can be mounted by hundreds of EC2 instances at once.
    - Works only with Linux-based EC2 instances.
    - AZ-independent: instances in different AZs can access the same EFS volume.

#### EFS vs. EBS
| Feature      | EBS            | EFS                 |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| AZ scope     | Single AZ only | Multi-AZ (shared)   |
| Mountable by | 1 instance     | Multiple instances  |
| Type         | Block storage  | Network file system |
| Data sharing | Not shared     | Shared              |

#### EFS Storage Classes
- **EFS Standard**: default, for frequently accessed files.
- **EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)**:
    - Up to 92% cheaper for rarely accessed files.
    - Files are moved automatically based on lifecycle policies.
    - File access is seamless; applications don't need to know the file‚Äôs storage class.

### Shared Responsibility Model for EC2 Storage
* **AWS manages the physical infrastructure**, replication, and secure isolation.
* **Customers are responsible for protecting their data**, through encryption, backup and snapshot procedures, and awareness of storage type limitations.

### Amazon FSx
- A fully managed service that provides third-party high-performance file systems on AWS. It complements services like EFS and S3 when specialized file system capabilities are needed.
- Two main FSx flavors for the exam: FSx for Windows File Server and FSx for Lustre:
    1. **FSx for Windows File Server**
        - Built on Windows File Server technology.
        - Supports SMB, NTFS, and integrates with Active Directory.
        - Ideal for Windows-based workloads.
        - Deployed across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
    2. **FSx for Lustre** ("Lustre" -> "Linux" and "cluster")
        - High-Performance Computing Linux file system.
        - Supports machine learning, analytics, video rendering, and more.
        - Provides millions of IOPS, sub-millisecond latency, and S3 integration.

## 5. ELB & ASG - Elastic Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Groups
### High Availability, Scalability, and Elasticity
- High Availability:
    - Running applications across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure service continuity during failures.
    - Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups support multi-AZ deployments.
- Scalability:
    - Vertical: Increasing instance size (e.g., t2.micro ‚Üí t2.large). Common in databases.
    - Horizontal: Adding more instances (e.g., 1 EC2 ‚Üí 6 EC2s). Requires distributed systems.
- Elasticity:
    - A cloud-native feature where resource scaling happens automatically based on demand, helping optimize cost.


### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- A managed AWS service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve scalability, availability, and resilience.
- ELB Types:
    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS, gRPC)
    - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
    - **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**: Layer 3 (IP layer)
    - **Classic Load Balancer (Old version)**
- ELB Type Definition and Purpose:
    - <img src="https://velog.velcdn.com/images/sunwupark/post/540e0211-ed49-4799-a9e8-5dd169b3f77e/image.png" height="250" width="500"/>

### Application Load Balancer (ALB) Hands On
<details>
    <summary>Demo + Summary</summary>
    - [Demo](https://youtu.be/ZGGpEwThhrM?si=tThFCM94QnBiaiNk)
---
#### **Application Load Balancer (ALB) ‚Äì Hands-On Summary**

#### EC2 Setup

* Launched **two EC2 instances** using Amazon Linux 2 (t2.micro).
* Added **user data scripts** to return "hello world" on HTTP.
* Verified both instances respond via their public IPs.

#### Creating the ALB

* Created an **Application Load Balancer**.
* Set it as **internet-facing** with **IPv4** in multiple Availability Zones.
* Assigned a new **security group** allowing HTTP (port 80).

#### Configuring Listeners and Target Group

* Created a **target group** (HTTP, port 80).
* **Registered both EC2 instances** as targets.
* Linked target group to ALB listener on port 80.
* Waited for the ALB to become active.

#### Verifying Load Balancing

* Accessed ALB **DNS name** ‚Üí confirmed it routes to EC2 instances.
* **Refreshed page**: traffic alternated between instances (load balancing working).
* Stopped one instance ‚Üí ALB automatically routed all traffic to the healthy instance.
* Restarted the instance ‚Üí once healthy, traffic resumed distributing to both.

#### Key Takeaways

* ALB **distributes HTTP traffic** across healthy EC2 targets.
* **Health checks** ensure traffic goes only to working instances.
* Demonstrated **resilience and automatic failover** using ALB.

</details>

### Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) & Hands On
- A service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- Key Features:
    - Scale out/in: Adds or removes instances based on load.
    - Health checks: Replaces unhealthy instances automatically.
    - **Min/Desired/Max** size settings define capacity boundaries.
    - Works with Load Balancer to route traffic to healthy instances.

</details>

### ASG Strategies
- Auto Scaling Groups can be optionally configured to adjust capacity automatically based on defined rules.
- Stategies:
    1. Manual Scaling
    2. Dynamic Scaling (reactive, metric-based)
        - Simple/Step Scaling: Triggered by CloudWatch alarms (e.g., scale out if CPU > 70%).
        - Target Tracking:Maintains a target metric (e.g., keep CPU at 40%) automatically.
        - Scheduled Scaling: Scaling at specific times.
    3. Predictive Scaling: Uses Machine Learning to forecast based on Historical patterns.

## 6. Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service
### S3
* **Core AWS storage**, known for **infinite scalability** (e.g., backup, disaster recovery, analytics, static websites).
* **Data is stored in buckets**, which are **region-specific** and must have **globally unique names**.
* **Objects** are files in buckets, identified by **keys**‚Äîthe full path to the file (S3 URL).
* Max object size: **5 TB**; use **multipart upload** for files > 5 GB.
* **Public URL** (returns Access Denied unless made public)
* [Demo](https://youtu.be/mDRoyPFJvlU?si=y981aLsS7g9-6Qmh)

### Amazon S3 Security
- S3 security is managed using two types of access control:
    - User-Based: [IAM Policies](#iam-policies)
    - Resourced-Based:
        - Bucket Policies: Policies that get attached to S3 Buckets
        - Object Access Control List (ACL)
        - Bucket Access Control List (ACL)
### Amazon S3 Security - Bucket Policies
- Bucket Policies:
    - JSON Base Policies
- Bucket Settings - Block Public Access:
    - Remove the risk of (company) data leak
### Amazon S3 Security - Accessing Bucket
- Access Methods:
    - Public Access - Use Bucket Policy
    - User Access - Use IAM permission/policy: An IAM principal can access an object **if allowed by IAM or bucket policy** and **no explicit deny exists**.
    - EC2 instance access - Use IAM Roles
    - Cross-Account Access - Use Bucket Policy

### S3 Website Hosting
* Hosts static sites like HTML, CSS, JS from an S3 bucket. Set **index.html** as homepage.
* Turn on **Static Website Hosting** in settings. No support for dynamic code (PHP, DB)
* Make bucket **public** to allow access
* Access via a public S3 website URL (e.g., `http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`)


### S3 Versioning
* **Enable Versioning:** Keeps all versions of an object when overwritten.
* **Upload New Versions:** Uploading a file with the same name adds a new version, not a replacement.
* **View Versions:** "Show versions" reveals version IDs, including older and current versions.
* **Rollback**: Permanently deleting the latest version to revert to a previous one.
* **Delete Marker:** Deleting an object will adds a delete marker, which hides the object; deleting the marker restores the previous version.

### S3 Replication & Hands On
* **Two types**: Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and Same-Region Replication (SRR).
* **Versioning** must be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
* **IAM permissions** are required for S3 to replicate data asynchronously.
* **CRR use cases**: compliance, cross-account access, and lower-latency access in another region.
* **SRR use cases**: log aggregation and syncing between production and test environments.


#### S3 Replication Hands On

    - [Demo](https://youtu.be/RV5AXsLR6p4?si=gyRGfH7Wr1FwevV9)
    ---
    #### S3 Replication Hands-On Summary

* **Created origin and target buckets** with versioning enabled in same or different regions.
* **Uploaded a file to the origin** bucket before replication‚Äîno replication occurred yet.
* **Configured a replication rule** on the origin bucket with IAM role and full-bucket scope.
* **Only new uploads after rule activation** (e.g., `coffee.jpeg`) are replicated automatically.
* **Replicated versioned updates** (e.g., new version of `beach.jpeg`) are copied with preserved version IDs.

</details>

### [S3 Storage Classes](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*5f2vK5Aixq40JYLFrcdh_A.png)

* **S3 Standard**: Default class for frequent access; **99.99% availability**, **low latency**, **multi-AZ**.
* **S3 Standard-IA**: For infrequent access; **lower cost**, **99.9% availability**, **retrieval fees**.
* **S3 One Zone-IA**: Like Standard-IA but **stored in one AZ only**; **99.5% availability**, risk of data loss if AZ fails.
* **S3 Glacier Classes**:
  * **Glacier Instant Retrieval**: Millisecond access, 90-day minimum.
  * **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: 1 min to 12 hrs access, 90-day minimum.
  * **Glacier Deep Archive**: 12‚Äì48 hrs access, 180-day minimum, **lowest cost**. Retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer.
  > Minimum storage duration: you‚Äôre billed for the full 90 or 180 days even if you delete the object early.
* **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Auto-moves data across tiers (frequent, infrequent, archive) **based on access patterns**; small monitoring fee, no retrieval fee.

### Comparison: S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA
| Feature                  | **S3 Standard**        | **S3 Standard-IA**                  | **S3 One Zone-IA**                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Availability Zones**   | 3+ AZs                 | 3+ AZs                              | **1 AZ only**                                                         |
| **Durability**           | 99.999999999% (11 9‚Äôs) | 99.999999999%                       | 99.999999999%                                                         |
| **Availability**         | 99.99%                 | 99.9%                               | **99.5%**                                                             |
| **Access Frequency**     | Frequent               | Infrequent                          | Infrequent                                                            |
| **Retrieval Time**       | Instant                | Instant                             | Instant                                                               |
| **Cost**                 | Highest                | Lower                               | **Lowest (20% cheaper than Standard-IA)**                             |
| **Use Case Suitability** | Active data            | Infrequent access but critical data | Infrequent access and **non-critical data** that can be **recreated** |

#### Main Difference:
- S3 One Zone-IA stores your data in just one AZ, so it costs less but is less resilient to AZ failure.
- Other classes (like Standard and Standard-IA) replicate data across at least 3 AZs, giving you higher availability and fault tolerance.

### S3 Lifecycle Rules
- Click in your S3 -> Management.
- Manually defined policies to transition objects between storage classes. You choose the timing and storage class transitions.
#### S3 Intelligent-Tiering vs Lifecycle Rules
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves objects between tiers based on access; best for unpredictable usage with a small monitoring fee.
- Lifecycle Rules: Manually set transitions based on time; best for predictable patterns with no monitoring cost.


### S3 Encryption
* **Server-side encryption** (default): S3 automatically encrypts objects on upload.
* **Client-side encryption**: Users encrypt data before uploading.
* Both models exist, but **server-side is enabled by default**.

Here‚Äôs a concise summary of the four topics:


### IAM Access Analyzer for S3

* Monitors S3 bucket access by analyzing bucket policies, ACLs, and access points.
* Identifies public or cross-account access so you can review and secure unintended exposure.


### Shared Responsibility Model (S3)

* **AWS:** Manages infrastructure, availability, and internal security.
* **You:** Responsible for setting up versioning, encryption, policies, logging, and storage class selection.


### AWS Snowball & Snowball Edge
- Purpose: Physical devices for moving large data or running compute in remote/offline locations.
- Types:
    - Storage Optimized ‚Äì 210 TB for bulk data transfer.
    - Compute Optimized ‚Äì 28 TB + supports EC2/Lambda at the edge.
- Pricing: Free to upload into S3; pay for device use & data leaving AWS.

### AWS Storage Gateway

* Bridges on-premises storage with AWS cloud in **hybrid cloud** setups.
* Enables backup, disaster recovery, and cloud tiering using services like **S3, Glacier, and EBS**. 
    * (AWS Storage Gateway works with these aws services behind the scene)
* Types include **File, Volume, and Tape Gateways**. (No need to remember)

### Summary of storage services in AWS
| **Service**            | **Type**                | **Description**                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon EBS**         | Block Storage           | Like a virtual hard drive for EC2 instances. Used for operating systems, apps.  |
| **Amazon EFS**         | File Storage            | Shared file system (like a network drive). Multiple EC2s can access it.         |
| **EC2 Instance Store** | Temporary/Ephemeral Block Storage | Fast, local storage tied to the EC2 instance ‚Äî **data lost on stop/terminate**. |
| **Amazon S3**          | Object Storage          | Stores files (objects) like images, videos, backups. Not a database.            |

## 7. Databases & Analytics

### Database
- Databases store structured data with indexes for fast search and querying.
- Unlike EBS, S3, or EFS, databases support relationships, queries, and data integrity.
- Managed (RDS, DynamoDB): AWS handles patching, backups, scaling, availability.
#### Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases (SQL): Structured like Excel, Use SQL for querying
2. NoSQL Databases: Flexible schema (e.g., JSON format).

* **Route 53** is AWS's managed DNS service that maps URLs to resources.
* **Record types**:
  * A / AAAA: Map to IPs.
  * CNAME: Map to another hostname.
  * Alias: Map to AWS resources (e.g., ELB, CloudFront).
* **Routing Policies**:
  * **Simple**: One IP, no health check.
  * **Weighted**: Traffic split by weights (with health checks).
  * **Latency**: Routes to lowest-latency region.
  * **Failover**: Switch to backup if the primary fails (with health checks).
* **Features**: Domain Registeration, DNS, Health Checks, Routing Policy
